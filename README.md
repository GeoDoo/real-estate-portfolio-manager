## API Design & Architecture

### API Envelope Standardization

The application uses a consistent API response envelope pattern for all endpoints to ensure predictable data structures and robust error handling.

#### Response Envelope Format

**List Endpoints** (return arrays of objects):
```json
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "1", "name": "Portfolio A" },
    { "id": "2", "name": "Portfolio B" }
  ]
}
```

**Single Object Endpoints** (return individual objects):
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Portfolio A",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses**:
```json
{
  "error": "Portfolio not found"
}
```

**Analytics Endpoints** (return named fields):
```json
{
  "cashFlows": [...],
  "irr": 12.5,
  "npv": 50000
}
```

#### Benefits of Envelope Pattern

1. **Consistency**: All endpoints follow the same response structure
2. **Type Safety**: Frontend can reliably expect `.items` or `.data` properties
3. **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses with `.error` property
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add metadata (pagination, timestamps, etc.) without breaking existing clients
5. **Robustness**: Prevents runtime errors from unexpected response formats

#### Implementation Details

**Backend (Flask)**:
- All route handlers return envelope-wrapped responses
- Validation utilities ensure consistent data structure
- Error handling returns `{ error: message }` format

**Frontend (TypeScript/React)**:
- API functions unwrap `.items` or `.data` from responses
- State variables initialized as empty arrays/objects
- Error handling expects `.error` property
- All list rendering uses `Array.isArray()` checks

### Code Quality Principles

The codebase follows these principles:

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simple, readable code over clever solutions
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Shared utilities for common operations
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Only implement what's currently needed
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across frontend and backend

### Performance Optimizations

- **SQLite Migration**: Comparable sales data moved from CSV to SQLite for faster queries
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- **Frontend Optimization**: Minimal re-renders and efficient state management
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling prevents app crashes

## Formulas & Financial Assumptions

This project uses industry-standard formulas for real estate investment analysis. All calculations are performed in the backend and are consistent across DCF, rental analysis, and Monte Carlo endpoints.

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model
- **Gross Rent (per year):**
  `gross_rent = annual_rental_income * (1 + annual_rent_growth/100) ** year`
- **Vacancy Loss:**
  `vacancy_loss = gross_rent * (vacancy_rate/100)`
- **Effective Rent:**
  `effective_rent = gross_rent - vacancy_loss`
- **Operating Expenses:**
  Sum of service charge, ground rent, maintenance, property tax, insurance, management fees, and CapEx (all annualized).
- **Net Operating Income (NOI):**
  `NOI = effective_rent - operating_expenses`
- **Net Cash Flow:**
  `net_cash_flow = NOI - mortgage_payment`
- **Discount Factor:**
  `discount_factor = 1 / (1 + discount_rate/100) ** year`
- **Present Value (PV):**
  `present_value = net_cash_flow * discount_factor`
- **Cumulative PV:**
  Sum of all present values up to the current year.

### Rental Analysis (Monthly Breakdown)
- **Gross Rental Income (monthly):**
  `gross_rental_income = annual_rental_income / 12`
- **Effective Rental Income:**
  `effective_rental_income = gross_rental_income * (1 - vacancy_rate/100)`
- **Management Fees:**
  `property_management = effective_rental_income * (management_fees/100)`
- **CapEx:**
  `capex = annual_capex / 12`
- **Monthly Cash Flow:**
  `cash_flow = effective_rental_income - (mortgage_payment + property_tax + insurance + maintenance + property_management + capex)`
- **ROI, Cap Rate, Cash-on-Cash:**
  Standard industry formulas using annualized values.

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Runs thousands of DCF simulations with random variations in rent growth, discount rate, and interest rate (using Gaussian (Normal) or Pareto (Power-law) distributions).
- All formulas are identical to the DCF model above, using a precise, loop-based approach for accuracy and maintainability.
- Summary statistics include mean, percentiles, probability of positive NPV, and valid IRR scenarios.

### General Assumptions
- All monetary values are in pounds (Â£) by default (user input).
- CapEx is always included as a separate expense.
- Management fees are a percentage of effective (not gross) rent.
- Vacancy rate is applied to gross rent to get effective rent.
- Mortgage payment is calculated using the standard amortization formula.
- All calculations are robust to zero or missing values (treated as zero).
- Floating point rounding is handled with small tolerances in tests.
